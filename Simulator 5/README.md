+
+This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic board game Risk. The simulator supports automated players with basic AI strategies and optional visualization using `pygame`.
+
+## Requirements
+
+- **Python** 3.9 or newer
+- **pygame** (for the graphical interface)
+
+## Installation
+
+1. Install Python and `pip` if they are not already available. On Debian/Ubuntu:
+
+   ```bash
+   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
+   ```
+
+2. Install the required Python packages:
+
+   ```bash
+   pip3 install pygame
+   ```
+
+   No additional thirdâ€‘party dependencies are needed.
+
+## Running the Simulator
+
+Execute the game from the repository root with:
+
+```bash
+python3 Simulator\ 5/main.py
+```
+
+The simulator will print game information to the terminal and open a Pygame window if your environment supports it. You can customize player settings in `Simulator 5/main.py`.
